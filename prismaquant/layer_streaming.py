"""Shared primitives for layer-by-layer streaming of HF model weights
from safetensors.

Used by the unified incremental probe, cost, and export paths. Each
primitive is a pure move from the original monolithic streaming probe —
signatures and behavior are byte-identical. The goal is to share one
install/unload/cache implementation across every stage of the pipeline
so the allocator's view of layer materialization is the same regardless
of which script is driving it.

Notes:
  - The `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` hack must be
    set by the *entrypoint* module before torch.cuda initializes; it is
    deliberately NOT set here so this module can be imported lazily
    after cuda is already up.
