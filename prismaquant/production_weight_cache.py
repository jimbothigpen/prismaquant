"""Production-faithful rendered-weight cache for measured candidates.

Per-Linear candidate probes and real-KL gates need to measure the same
rendered weights that export will ship. Without this cache the perturbation
installed into the model is bare RTN. The export pipeline renders weights with
several activation-aware passes; the shipped δw is much smaller than the RTN
δw at the same format.

This module pre-renders `W_tilde[name, fmt]` once, using the production
quantization path:

  IMPLEMENTED (v1):
    * scalar GPTQ (with damp sweep when env-enabled)
    * optional scalar scale-sweep
    * joint NVFP4 fused-sibling globals (q/k/v share a per-tensor scale,
      gate/up share theirs)
    * calibrated `input_global_scale` per fused-sibling group
      (max_abs(activations) / 6.0; the same value the export persists
      to the artifact)
    * progressive local render gates using the shared mechanism order
      baseline -> format scale rule -> GPTQ -> optional scale_sweep;
      individual formats explicitly opt out of unsupported mechanisms,
      and regressive candidates fall back to the previous accepted render
      while recording metadata
    * FP8_DYNAMIC/FP8_E4M3 per-row scale search when scale_sweep is enabled;
      explicit MXFP8 E8M0 scale search remains opt-in. These refine the current
      accepted render rather than starting a separate format-specific path
    * activation-weighted GPTQ for FP8_DYNAMIC/FP8_E4M3. Explicit MXFP8 keeps
      GPTQ support for research/legacy artifacts. NVFP4 is the only production
      format that uses joint_scale_opt; MXFP8 uses the canonical E8M0 scale rule.
    * retired Fisher-weighted local objectives are archived under
      ``archive/fisher_2026-05-15/`` and are not part of the production
      pipeline
    * retired input-axis rotation experiments are not part of the production
      cache path.

  KNOWN GAPS (v2 work, NOT implemented):
    * batched NVFP4 GPTQ + scale-sweep across same-shape Linears
      (defaults-on in the export when activations are cached;
      mathematically equivalent to scalar but ~3-8× faster on MoE)
    * block-output match (post-GPTQ refinement against BF16 block output)
    * any export-only refinements added after this docstring is written

  FP8_DYNAMIC / BF16:
    * FP8_DYNAMIC is represented by the canonical FP8_E4M3 format name:
      per-output-row FP32 weight scales and per-token dynamic activation
      scales. It uses GPTQ damp-sweep by default in production render.
    * Explicit MXFP8/MXFP4 formats remain available only when requested.
    * BF16 is passthrough.

PerturbedActivationCache installs `W_tilde` (and applies the calibrated
`input_global_scale` on activations) instead of RTN-quantizing on the
fly, so per-Linear probes, frontier validation, and polish gates use the
same δw the export will deliver, modulo the v2 gaps above.

Usage:

    cache = fill_production_weight_cache(
        model, calib_ids, qnames=qnames, formats=["NVFP4"],
    )
    cache.validate_coverage(qnames, ["NVFP4"])  # raise on misses
    perturbed_cache = PerturbedActivationCache(
        ..., production_weight_cache=cache,
    )

      * ``str`` (a path) — points to a per-Linear .pt file on disk;
        ``get()`` lazy-loads on first access and memoizes the tensor

    Disk-streaming mode (when ``cache_dir`` is set during fill) keeps
    fill-time peak memory bounded — only one weight is in RAM at a time
    instead of the full ~25 GB stack of all rendered Linears.  At

    fused-sibling NVFP4 global if supplied; for BF16 and RTN-only formats

    don't benefit from activation-aware refinement in the production pipeline.

    per-Linear computed value is used (legacy behavior, only correct for
    isolated Linears with no fused siblings).

    ``act_clip_threshold`` is an optional scalar clamp for activation-aware

    Packed 3-D MoE experts are not ``nn.Linear`` and so are invisible to
    ``_LinearActivationCollector``.  This collector hooks the experts module
    itself and reservoir-samples its module-level input (the pre-routing token
    hidden states ``[*, hidden]``).  At render time the captured ``X`` is split
    into per-expert routed rows by ``derive_per_expert_activations`` — the same
    routing the live forward used — so each expert's GPTQ Hessian sees exactly
    the rows that route to it.

    The per-module token budget (``module_token_budget``) is intentionally much
    larger than the per-Linear ``max_rows`` budget: with top-k routing over E
    experts each expert only sees ~``top_k/E`` of the tokens, so a stable
    per-expert Hessian needs ``~max_rows_per_expert * E / top_k`` module tokens.

    """Render packed-MoE experts into ``ProductionWeightCache`` entries.

    ``render_mode``:
      * ``"batched"`` (default, production): vectorize the GPTQ column update
        across all experts of a layer via ``gptq_obs_rounding_nvfp4_batched``
        — ~E× fewer Python iterations than per-expert. Fixed damp, no JSO/
        act-order (those force a per-expert loop that is ~hours on a 35B).
      * ``"per_expert"``: render each expert through the full
        ``render_production_weight`` stack (progressive gates + damp-sweep +
        JSO + do-no-harm). Faithful to the dense path but ~hours on a 35B;
        used for the fidelity A/B that justifies the production default.

    ``gate_calib_ids``: optional token ids from a corpus DISJOINT from
    ``calib_ids``. When given, the per-expert GPTQ-vs-RTN do-no-harm gate is
    judged on this corpus's routed rows instead of a same-corpus held-out
    slice, and GPTQ fits on ALL fit-corpus rows. Rationale (2026-06-09 served
    A/B): per-expert Hessians are thin (sparse routing), so GPTQ overfits its
    calibration *domain* — a same-domain holdout catches in-sample overfit but
    passed renders that LOST on served cross-domain KL (RTN 0.0302 vs GPTQ
    0.0334 confident). Experts the gate corpus never routes to fall back to
    the same-domain holdout. Default ``None`` preserves prior behavior.

    This closes the packed-expert RTN-by-omission gap: every non-BF16 packed
    expert tensor receives a deliberate cache render keyed by routed
    per-expert activations. In production's default ``"batched"`` mode that
    render is fixed-damp batched GPTQ without dense JSO/act-order/damp-sweep,
    followed by the measured GPTQ-vs-RTN gate below. The non-default
    ``"per_expert"`` mode is the one that calls ``render_production_weight``
    and matches the dense GPTQ+damp-sweep+JSO stack. Export then reads the
    cached 3-D dequant and re-packs it — exactly the
    ``_pack_production_cached_2d`` contract, lifted to packed experts.

    Args:
      cache: the ``ProductionWeightCache`` produced by
        ``fill_production_weight_cache``.  New 3-D ``(experts_qname.pn, fmt)``
        entries are added in place (and streamed to ``cache_dir`` shards when
        disk-streaming is on).
      render_assignment: the concrete export assignment (recipe_key -> fmt).
        Only non-BF16 packed-expert tensors are rendered (BF16 = passthrough).
      levers: the resolved production lever dict. It is consumed by
        ``render_mode="per_expert"``; the production ``"batched"`` path uses
        its fixed fast recipe regardless of dense-linears JSO/damp-sweep
        levers.
      module_token_budget: reservoir size for each experts module's input X.
      max_rows_per_expert: cap on routed rows fed to each expert's GPTQ.
      max_layers: debug/timing cap — render only the first N experts modules.
      module_acts_override: streaming build. ``{experts_qname: X}`` module-level
        input snapshots sourced from the probe's activation cache instead of a
        fresh forward pass. When supplied, no calibration forward runs, in-scope
        experts are restricted to the supplied modules (the currently-installed
        decoder layer), ``calib_ids`` may be ``None``, and the cross-domain gate
        corpus is unsupported.

    Returns a coverage dict consumed by the export enforcement gate:
      ``{experts_qname.pn: {"fmt", "n_experts", "min_rows", "median_rows",
      "rendered", "had_activations"}}``.
