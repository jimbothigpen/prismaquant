"""Aura cost: KL-adjoint per-Linear sensitivity surrogate.

Produces an allocator-compatible ``cost.pkl`` whose per-(Linear, format)
``predicted_dloss`` is the second-order KL contribution of quantizing that
Linear, measured against the **KL/Gauss-Newton Fisher** (not the CE empirical
Fisher) and the **production-rendered** weight error:

    predicted_dloss[i, f] = 0.5 * mean_k ( <gW_i^(k), dW_{i,f}> )^2

    gW_i^(k) = d/dW_i [ fisher_probe_scalar(logits; seed=k) ]   (kl_fisher probe;
               E_k[gW_i gW_i^T] = the layer Fisher w.r.t. the model KL)
    dW_{i,f} = Q_f(W_i) - W_i  (production-rendered error from ProductionWeight
               Cache when available, else the format-registry RTN error)

Why this is the right cost (rung-0 validated, 2026-06-04):
  * end-KL is locally a Fisher quadratic in the logit displacement, and the
    per-Linear unary KLs are **additive in fp32** (cross-terms ~0), so summing
    these per-Linear costs is a faithful end-KL surrogate -- the additive
    knapsack is sound once each per-Linear term is the KL-Fisher quantity.
  * <gW_i^(k), dW> = r_k . (J_i dY_i) is the probe projection of the propagated
    logit displacement; 0.5*mean_k(.)^2 is the unbiased estimator of
    0.5 * dY_i^T (J_i^T F J_i) dY_i = the unary KL contribution.
  * This is the analytic O(N) generalization of the validated 35B serving-unit
    propagated-sensitivity win (no hand-tuned scale, covers all Linears).

Reuses kl_fisher (probe), ProductionWeightCache (dW), format_registry (RTN
fallback), schemas (cost.pkl contract). Sets output_mse_measured=False so
allocator_candidates.cost_entry_predicted_dloss consumes predicted_dloss
directly. Measurement defaults to fp32 (the precision the additivity result
requires); memory-safe (one autograd graph at a time, watchdog-gated).
