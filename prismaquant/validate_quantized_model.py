"""Pre-ship quality validator for PrismaQuant artifacts.

Designed to catch the class of failure that shipped a broken 27B
checkpoint to HF in this session: predicted Δloss said the artifact
was *better* than its predecessor (13.5% lower), but the actual
model produced ~10,000× worse perplexity because the allocator's
fused-sibling sum-aggregation under-weighted asymmetric sensitivity.

The predicted-Δloss heuristic is not enough. Every artifact must
pass *measured* quality gates before upload.

Checks, in order:

  1. **Serve check** — vLLM actually starts the model (load, MTP
     wrapper, CUDA graph capture) with the recipe's flags.
  2. **Generation sanity** — small set of prompts must produce
     coherent outputs. Filters obvious catastrophic breakage
     (NaN/repetition loops/nonsense) before wasting on stats.
  3. **Perplexity / NLL** — logprobs over a diverse held-out
     prompt suite. Hard thresholds: `ppl < MAX_PPL` and
     worst per-prompt NLL < `MAX_P99_NLL` (legacy flag name).
     The worst-prompt guard catches the 27B failure mode where
     80% of prompts scored NLL~10 while 2/10 scored normally.
  4. **MTP acceptance** — if spec-decode is on, per-position
     acceptance > `MIN_MTP_ACCEPT_P0` at position 0.

Use from CI or pre-ship hook:

    python -m prismaquant.validate_quantized_model \\
        --artifact /path/to/exported \\
        --baseline rdtand/<previous-known-good>     # optional
        --report /path/to/report.md

Exit 0 = all checks passed. Exit 1 = at least one check failed
(prints a report to stdout + writes `--report` markdown).

**Workflow for artifacts with speculative decoding (MTP / Eagle):**
run the validator twice, against two different serves.

  1. Serve WITHOUT `--speculative-config`, run validator → the
     perplexity check produces target-model NLL and a meaningful
     verdict. MTP acceptance is skipped because no drafts fire.

  2. Re-serve WITH `--speculative-config`, run validator → the
     perplexity check will refuse to run (it detects spec-decode
     via /metrics and fails with a diagnostic rather than silently
     return draft-model NLL). MTP acceptance runs and reports
     position-0 accept rate.

The model is "ship-ready" only if both passes succeed. This is
awkward but honest: vLLM offers no target-model logprob path
while spec-decode is active, and faking perplexity from the draft
model has already burned one false-FAIL in the session that spawned
this file.

Design notes:
  - We use vLLM's OpenAI API for logprobs via /v1/completions
    with `echo=True`, which echoes the prompt tokens with their
    prior logprobs.
  - Model serving is run in a subprocess / docker exec so we
    can tear it down cleanly between runs.
  - Prompts span science, history, CS, economics, everyday prose
    to catch domain-specific failure. Short enough to keep a full
    suite under ~30s at spec-decode speed.
  - Thresholds are calibrated: MAX_PPL=25 catches catastrophic
    breakage but tolerates normal 4-bit quant degradation
    (BF16 baseline ~3-5, 4-bit ~4-8). MAX_P99_NLL=6 is ~2σ above
    BF16 average; the implementation also reports the actual p99
    separately from the max prompt NLL.

    teacher-forced without one. Some exports ship ``add_bos_token=false`` in
    their tokenizer_config, so ``add_special_tokens=True`` alone does NOT add
    it — pass ``bos_token`` (e.g. ``"<bos>"``) to prepend it explicitly. When
    ``bos_token`` is given the request uses ``add_special_tokens=False`` to
    avoid a double-BOS. NOTE: raw-text PPL is also a weak quant-quality signal
    on heavily instruction-tuned models (the off-distribution penalty swamps
    the quantization delta); prefer KL-vs-BF16 for quant A/Bs there.

    Hard fails when mean NLL exceeds threshold OR when the worst

    bimodal-failure where the model has "quality pockets" (see 27B
