"""Regression for issue #4 — meta-init CUDA mask poisoning the fla fast path.

Several transformers modeling files (Qwen3.5/3.6 MoE, Qwen3-Next, OLMo-hybrid)
bind their gated-delta-rule FAST PATH at *module import time* behind a
`@lru_cache`d, CUDA-gated `if is_flash_linear_attention_available():`. PrismaQuant
builds the meta skeleton inside `_mask_cuda_queries_during_meta_init`, which sets
`torch.cuda.is_available = lambda: False`. If the modeling module is first
imported in that window, the availability check caches False and the fast path
is silently lost for the whole process.

The fix re-primes those lru_cached availability checks with CUDA visible BEFORE
masking. This test asserts the priming happens, clears the cache, and runs
*before* the mask takes effect — without needing fla/CUDA actually installed.
