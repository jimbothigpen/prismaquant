# Qwen3.6-27B SMRF validation

Date: 2026-05-17
Branch: `clado-plugin-integration`
Run: `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-standard-20260517T000000Z`

Status: archived. SMRF/PrismaSCOUT remains research-only and should not be
used as a live allocator or export path. Earlier low-budget points had
interesting KL wins, but held-out WikiText PPL favored matched PQ, high-bpp
SMRF lost to standard PQ, and the 2026-05-23 post-NVFP4-fix revival did not
beat the current fixed 5.5-bit PQ artifact under exact full-vocab vLLM KL.

## Fixes made during validation

Two accounting/legalization issues were fixed before interpreting the
27B results:

- Allocator Pareto assignment JSONs now apply the final MTP BF16 override.
  The previous Pareto seed artifacts could quantize MTP even when the
  final `layer_config` did not.
- Allocator bpp budgeting now excludes forced BF16 MTP and pinned names
  from the DP denominator. MTP BF16 remains in assignment JSONs for export
  coverage; `lm_head` is excluded from budgeting and omitted from
  assignments.
- `validate_assignments_kl` now reports bpp over quantizable parameters
  only, excluding pinned names and BF16 source-passthrough entries.

Tests:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_allocator_pareto_seed_export.py \
  tests/test_validate_assignments_kl_bpp.py \
  tests/test_smrf_runtime.py -q
```

Result: `9 passed`.

## n=16 screen

The broad n=16 hook screen was useful for candidate discovery but was not
stable enough to call a winner.

- SMRF output:
  `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-standard-20260517T000000Z/artifacts/smrf_vs_pq_n16_kl_no_frozen.json`

  and
  `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-standard-20260517T000000Z/logs/validate_pq_budgetlegal2_n16.log`

The hook path required `--disable-frozen-weight-cache`; otherwise the
frozen hook cache exceeded the 27B GPU budget after production cache
prefetch.

## n=256 in-place finalists

Validation used the same production-rendered in-place path with
`--n-calib-samples 256`. The first attempt failed fast because the
required production-cache file prefetch size was 42.54 GiB and the
derived budget was 42.45 GiB. The rerun set
`--production-cache-file-prefetch-max-gb 48`, preserving required
resident prefetch while avoiding the near-miss budget failure.

| pq_012 | 7.665841 | 0.015035 | matched high-bpp PQ beat SMRF |

At the practical 5.24 bpp target, SMRF improved KL by 0.002403
absolute, or about 11.23% relative to matched PQ. That KL win did not
hold for the high-bpp point: matched PQ improved KL by 0.002881 absolute,
or about 19.16% relative to SMRF.

## vLLM export and PPL

The low-bpp SMRF and matched PQ assignments were expanded over the same
base assignment and checked for runtime legality before export:

- SMRF layer config:
  `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-standard-20260517T000000Z/artifacts/vllm_low_bpp_inputs/smrf_003_layer_config_full.json`
- PQ layer config:
  `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-standard-20260517T000000Z/artifacts/vllm_low_bpp_inputs/pq_003_layer_config_full.json`
- Runtime coercions: `0` for both.

Export run:
`/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z`

Exports used the same production weight cache direct path:

- SMRF: 370 NVFP4, 4 MXFP8, 240 BF16 assignment entries.
- PQ: 364 NVFP4, 250 BF16 assignment entries.
- Each artifact wrote 6 safetensors shards, about 21.25 GiB.
- Export logs:
  `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/logs/export_smrf_003.log`
  and
  `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/logs/export_pq_003.log`

Both artifacts passed vLLM eager and graph-mode load/generation with
`quantization=compressed-tensors`. SMRF selected
`FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel` and
`FlashInferCutlassMxfp8LinearKernel`; PQ selected
`FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel`. A stale optional
`prismaquant_residual_adapter` plugin entry logged an import error, but
vLLM continued and completed generation in all four smokes.

Smoke logs:

| artifact | eager log | graph log |
|---|---|---|
| smrf_003 | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/logs/validate_native_export_smrf_003_eager.log` | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/logs/validate_native_export_smrf_003_graph.log` |
| pq_003 | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/logs/validate_native_export_pq_003_eager.log` | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/logs/validate_native_export_pq_003_graph.log` |

WikiText PPL was measured through vLLM with compressed-tensors, sequence
length 512, graph mode, and `FLASHINFER_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1`.
The vLLM container did not include `datasets`, so the ephemeral
validation container installed `datasets==4.6.0` before running PPL.

| artifact | tokens scored | mean NLL | PPL | output |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| smrf_003 32k | 32,704 | 2.135831 | 8.464077 | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/smrf_003/wikitext_ppl_32k.json` |
| pq_003 32k | 32,704 | 2.132949 | 8.439722 | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/pq_003/wikitext_ppl_32k.json` |
| smrf_003 64k | 65,408 | 2.151340 | 8.596369 | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/smrf_003/wikitext_ppl_64k.json` |
| pq_003 64k | 65,408 | 2.149144 | 8.577513 | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/pq_003/wikitext_ppl_64k.json` |

The 64k PPL run favored PQ by 0.018857 PPL, a 0.22% relative SMRF
regression. The smaller 32k run also favored PQ by 0.024355 PPL, a
0.29% relative SMRF regression.

## vLLM ToolEvalBench

ToolEvalBench is now part of the standard vLLM downstream suite alongside
PPL and log-likelihood style checks. The benchmark was run against both
materialized low-bpp artifacts using the same sequential hardmode shape
as the stored 27B ToolEvalBench runs:

```bash
tool-eval-bench \
  --backend vllm \
  --base-url http://localhost:8000/v1 \
  --temperature 0 \
  --seed 1234 \
  --timeout 180 \
  --no-think \
  --hardmode \
  --parallel 1
```

Serving settings matched the previous 27B ToolEvalBench convention:
`vllm-fresh-b12x-fla:latest`, compressed-tensors, graph mode,
`--max-model-len 32768`, FP8 KV cache, prefix caching, tool choice
enabled, `qwen3_coder` tool parser, `qwen3` reasoning parser, and
safetensors prefetch. Both artifacts selected performant kernels:
SMRF used `FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel` and
`FlashInferCutlassMxfp8LinearKernel`; PQ used
`FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel`.

| artifact | score | points | pass / partial / fail | responsiveness | deployability | report |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| smrf_003 | 87 / 100 | 129 / 148 | 60 / 9 / 5 | 32 / 100 | 70 / 100 | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-vllm-20260517T124500Z/tooleval_smrf_003/runs/2026/05/2026-05-17T18-06-25Z_7e3bd4.md` |

- SMRF ToolEvalBench log:

The headline ToolEvalBench result is a tie. The failures are not
identical:

- SMRF was better on `TC-03`, `TC-31`, `TC-50`, and `TC-57`.
- PQ was better on `TC-29`, `TC-42`, `TC-52`, and `TC-74`.
- Both failed `TC-48`, `TC-60`, and `TC-72`.
- Both triggered the critical `TC-60` cross-turn sleeper-injection
  failure.

## Conclusion

Do not promote SMRF as a general/default Qwen3.6-27B method.

At the low-budget point, SMRF improved n=256 KL by 0.002403 absolute
against matched PQ, or about 11.23% relative. Its held-out WikiText PPL
was slightly worse than matched PQ, but the 64k regression was 0.22% and
the 32k regression was 0.29%, both below the usual 0.5% preservation
tolerance. ToolEvalBench tied matched PQ exactly at 87 / 100 and
129 / 148 points.

That was enough evidence to keep the low-budget SMRF point as a research
checkpoint at the time, but not enough to keep it live after the later FP4
fixes and standard-PQ reruns. Corrected standard PQ is the default baseline.
Any future SMRF revival should be treated as a new archived research effort
and must clear exact vLLM KL, held-out PPL/mean NLL, log-likelihood
downstream tasks, ToolEvalBench, and vLLM eager/graph materialization checks
before export is considered.

## Refined solver rerun

Run:
`/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-refined-20260517T204108Z`

After the initial 27B result, SMRF candidate generation was updated to:

- weight Lagrangian penalties by each unit's true bpp contribution rather
  than raw `bits_per_param`;
- use slope-derived lambda coverage instead of a coarse linear lambda grid;
- re-check serving legality per fused member after aggregation;
- keep profile-pinned or passthrough members out of aggregated SMRF units;
- emit richer archive diagnostics, block format histograms, hamming distance
  from injected baselines, and included matched-PQ rows;
- support KL repeat summaries and UCB fields in validation output;
- support practical-knee, UCB, rank-correlation, and leave-one-out kneedle
  diagnostics in measured-frontier selection.

Targeted tests:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_smrf_runtime.py \
  tests/test_select_validated_frontier.py \
  tests/test_validate_assignments_kl_bpp.py -q
```

Result: `17 passed`.

Refined candidate generation used the same 27B probe/cost/base inputs as
above, with `n_lambdas=81`, `bit_precision_bpp=0.01`,
`beam_per_bin=4`, `validation_candidates=33`, and injected matched PQ
assignments for `pq_003`, `pq_004`, and `pq_010`.

Generation log:
`/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-refined-20260517T204108Z/logs/smrf_generate_refined.log`

Generation summary:

- Generated archive rows: 1,530.
- Surrogate frontier points: 583.

- Mean surrogate-frontier bpp gap: 0.006440.
- Validation manifest rows: 34, including three matched PQ baselines.

The refined search selected a low-budget lambda candidate,
`smrf_005`, at 5.233916 bpp. A 2x64 screen showed high variance for
this candidate:

| assignment | bpp | KL repeats | mean KL | UCB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| smrf_004 | 5.214804 | 0.017660, 0.051021 | 0.034341 | 0.051021 |
| smrf_005 | 5.233916 | 0.015236, 0.026851 | 0.021044 | 0.026851 |
| pq_003 | 5.241576 | 0.017640, 0.016271 | 0.016955 | 0.017640 |

The final apples-to-apples check used the same no-FLA CUDA docket image
as the earlier KL logs, `vllm-eugr-v020:latest`, because the FLA-enabled
container takes a different model execution path. Validation used
`--n-calib-samples 256`, sequence length 1024, `last_token` KL,
in-place materialization, and required source/production-cache prefetch.

Final n=256 result:

| assignment | bpp | KL | output MSE | formats | log |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| smrf_005 | 5.233916 | 0.022896 | 2.452648 | 250 BF16, 364 NVFP4 | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-refined-20260517T204108Z/logs/final_n256_eugr_inplace/smrf_005.log` |
| pq_003 | 5.241576 | 0.021408 | 2.396772 | 250 BF16, 364 NVFP4 | `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-refined-20260517T204108Z/logs/final_n256_eugr_inplace/pq_003.log` |

Selection summary:
`/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-refined-20260517T204108Z/artifacts/final_n256_eugr_inplace/selected_best_summary.json`

Result: the refined low-budget SMRF candidate did not beat matched PQ.
`pq_003` improved KL by 0.001488 absolute versus `smrf_005`, a 6.50%
relative reduction from `smrf_005`. The corrected/wider solver therefore
does not replace the previous low-budget SMRF result, and it weakens the
case for promoting SMRF as a default 27B method.

## MXFP8 ablation and warmed throughput

Run:
`/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-mxfp8-ablation-20260518T000000Z`

The original low-budget `smrf_003` used four MXFP8 linears:

- `model.layers.13.mlp.down_proj`
- `model.layers.19.self_attn.o_proj`
- `model.layers.27.self_attn.o_proj`
- `model.layers.31.self_attn.o_proj`

An all-NVFP4 ablation replaced those four entries with NVFP4. The full
export layer config then had `240 BF16 / 374 NVFP4` entries and no MXFP8.
The exporter runtime-legality audit reported zero coercions.

Artifacts:

- Assignment:
  `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-mxfp8-ablation-20260518T000000Z/artifacts/smrf_003_all_nvfp4_assignment_e7ab016bc017.json`

  `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-mxfp8-ablation-20260518T000000Z/smrf_003_all_nvfp4/exported`

n=256 no-FLA KL replay used the same production-cache in-place path as the
earlier final checks:

| assignment | bpp | KL | output MSE | formats |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| smrf_003 mixed | 5.241438 | 0.019005 | - | 240 BF16, 370 NVFP4, 4 MXFP8 |
| smrf_003 all-NVFP4 | 5.213179 | 0.020139 | 2.772540 | 240 BF16, 374 NVFP4 |
| pq_003 | 5.241576 | 0.021408 | 2.396772 | 250 BF16, 364 NVFP4 |

The all-NVFP4 ablation gives back 0.001134 KL versus mixed SMRF, but it
still beats matched PQ by 0.001269 absolute while using slightly fewer
bits. This keeps the low-budget SMRF neighborhood interesting, but it also
shows that the four MXFP8 choices were not just runtime noise; they carried
some KL value.

The all-NVFP4 export completed through the production-cache direct path in
five safetensors shards. It passed vLLM eager and graph-mode load/generation
with `quantization=compressed-tensors` and selected only
`FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel`.

The earlier PPL wall-clock comparison made SMRF look much slower, but that
measurement mixed model init, profiling, and first-run behavior into the
elapsed time. A separate warmed graph-mode throughput benchmark used
case-specific warmups and reported median steady-state throughput:

| artifact | case | prompt tokens | median wall s | decode tok/s | total tok/s |

Throughput summary:
`/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-mxfp8-ablation-20260518T000000Z/artifacts/throughput_graph/summary.json`

Interpretation: the 2x slowdown did not reproduce in steady-state serving.
Mixed SMRF has extra init/autotune overhead from the MXFP8 kernel path, but
steady-state throughput is within about 1.5% of PQ on these shapes.
All-NVFP4 removes the MXFP8 init/autotune path and is slightly faster than
PQ on short decode and the 1.5k prompt case, but still about 0.9% slower
than PQ on the 3k prompt case.

Held-out WikiText 64k PPL for all-NVFP4:

| artifact | tokens scored | mean NLL | PPL |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| pq_003 64k | 65,408 | 2.149144 | 8.577513 |
| smrf_003 mixed 64k | 65,408 | 2.151340 | 8.596369 |
| smrf_003 all-NVFP4 64k | 65,408 | 2.150811 | 8.591824 |

All-NVFP4 improves PPL slightly versus mixed SMRF, but still trails PQ by
0.014311 PPL, a 0.17% relative regression. That is under the usual 0.5%
preservation tolerance, but it is directionally worse despite better KL.

Recommendation: keep SMRF archived. The low-budget neighborhood was
interesting before the FP4 fixes, but the current fixed standard-PQ artifact
is the stronger baseline. If this line of work is revived, the next useful
step is not another surrogate-only SMRF sweep; it is validation-guided local
search around the fixed PQ allocation with exact vLLM KL and held-out PPL as
acceptance gates. The allocator should also keep serving-kernel mix as an
explicit runtime cost or constraint rather than treating MXFP8 and NVFP4 as
interchangeable once both are shape-legal.

## MXFP8 subset search

The next search enumerated all 16 subsets of the four MXFP8 choices in the
original low-budget `smrf_003`:

- bit 0: `model.layers.13.mlp.down_proj`
- bit 1: `model.layers.19.self_attn.o_proj`
- bit 2: `model.layers.27.self_attn.o_proj`
- bit 3: `model.layers.31.self_attn.o_proj`

  `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-mxfp8-ablation-20260518T000000Z/artifacts/mxfp8_subset_n256_summary.json`

The n=64 hook screen was not predictive enough for promotion. It ranked
`mxsubset_05_2mxfp8` first at KL 0.014636, but the n=256 in-place
confirmation for that same assignment was KL 0.025287. Because in-place
materialization is destructive, each n=256 subset was run as a separate
validator invocation with a clean model load.

n=256 no-FLA subset results:

| assignment | enabled MXFP8 bits | bpp | KL | output MSE |

| `mxsubset_06_2mxfp8` | 1,2 | 5.222868 | 0.031406 | 2.772330 |

`mxsubset_14_3mxfp8` is the best n=256 KL point in this neighborhood. It
removes the layer 13 MLP MXFP8 choice from the original mixed SMRF point,
keeps MXFP8 on the three attention `o_proj` entries, reduces bpp by
0.013726, and improves KL by 0.000548 absolute versus original mixed SMRF.

The runtime-legality audit used the `qwen3_5_dense` model profile and
reported zero coercions. The exported recipe was `240 BF16 / 371 NVFP4 /
3 MXFP8`, with 371 NVFP4 and 3 MXFP8 linears served from the existing
production weight cache.

vLLM eager and graph-mode smokes both passed with
`quantization=compressed-tensors`. The logs show
`FlashInferCutlassNvFp4LinearKernel` for NVFP4 GEMM and
`FlashInferCutlassMxfp8LinearKernel` for MXFP8 GEMM.

Held-out WikiText 64k PPL rejected the KL-only winner:

| artifact | tokens scored | mean NLL | PPL |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| pq_003 64k | 65,408 | 2.149144 | 8.577513 |
| smrf_003 mixed 64k | 65,408 | 2.151340 | 8.596369 |

| mxsubset_14_3mxfp8 64k | 65,408 | 2.152858 | 8.609431 |

`mxsubset_14_3mxfp8` worsens PPL by 0.031918 versus matched PQ, about
0.37% relative. It also worsens PPL versus both the original mixed SMRF
artifact and the all-NVFP4 ablation. This is still inside a loose 0.5%
preservation bound, but the direction is wrong and the degradation is
larger than the earlier SMRF variants.

Warmed graph-mode throughput for `mxsubset_14_3mxfp8` was also weaker than
PQ on the tested shapes:

| artifact | case | prompt tokens | median wall s | decode tok/s | total tok/s |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mxsubset_14_3mxfp8 | decode_128 | 12 | 11.422 | 11.206 | 12.257 |
| mxsubset_14_3mxfp8 | prefill_1k_decode_32 | 1540 | 3.354 | 9.540 | 468.637 |
| mxsubset_14_3mxfp8 | prefill_2k_decode_32 | 3080 | 3.990 | 8.021 | 780.042 |

Throughput result:
`/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-mxfp8-ablation-20260518T000000Z/artifacts/throughput_graph/mxsubset_14_3mxfp8.json`

Conclusion: do not promote `mxsubset_14_3mxfp8` despite its n=256 KL win.
This is a concrete example where last-token KL on the calibration contract
is not sufficient as the sole acceptance metric. The SMRF acceptance gate
should require a repeat-stable KL improvement and a non-regressing held-out
PPL/mean-NLL result before any ToolEvalBench spend or 27B-to-35B scale-up.
For low-budget 27B, the most defensible SMRF artifact remains the
all-NVFP4 ablation as a research checkpoint: it keeps lower bpp and a KL
edge over matched PQ without the extra MXFP8 serving path, but it still does
not beat PQ on held-out PPL.

## Post-NVFP4-fix revival check

Date: 2026-05-23
Run: `/home/rob/dq-runs/qwen36-27b-smrf-review-20260523T202318Z`

After the NVFP4 renderer/export fixes, SMRF was briefly revived against the
current fixed 27B 5.5-bit PQ artifact. The archived solver was not promoted
or moved back into the live pipeline; it was used only to generate narrow
candidate deltas around the fixed PQ allocation.

Exact full-vocab vLLM KL results against the BF16 teacher:

| artifact | bpp | local output MSE | exact vLLM KL |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| current fixed 5.5 PQ | 5.4998 | 0.0961 | 0.0344416 |
| shipped 5.5 | - | - | 0.0474975 |
| fixed PQ + six layer54/56/58 NVFP4-to-FP8 moves | 5.5000 | 0.0862 | 0.0436522 |
| same + layer60 gate/up FP8-to-NVFP4 offset | 5.4744 | 0.0871 | 0.0463870 |
| prior full SMRF-like candidate | 5.4742 | 0.0888 | 0.0594489 |

The best isolated SMRF-derived move improved the local MSE surrogate and beat
the shipped 5.5 artifact, but it did not beat the current fixed 5.5 PQ
artifact. Adding the SMRF offsetting demotion worsened exact KL. This closes
the post-fix revival: SMRF remains archived and should not be used as a
shipping candidate generator without a new deployment-validated research
plan.
